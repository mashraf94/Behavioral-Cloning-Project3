# Behavioral-Cloning-Project3
In this project, deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks are used to clone a driver's behavior. The model is an imitation of the NVIDIA architecture with a couple of enhancements. The proposed model will predict a steering angle to an autonomous vehicle that drives around the tracks.

To autonomously drive the car in Udacity's simulator using the proposed [model](model.h5):

1. Enter `python drive.py model.h5` in terminal
2. Launch Simulator in Autonomous mode
